### 1

In post-industrial societies where mass production and mainstream media
predominate society, life is presented as an immense accumulation of
_spectacles_. Everything that was directly experienced has been replaced with
its representation in the form of images.

> _"directly experienced"_ A life experience in which an individual directly
> participates. For example, acting in a play at a local theatrical festival, or
> as simple as playing a game of soccer with friends. A concrete example of the
> replacement of direct experience with its representation is how the previously
> common practice of hunting for animals which will be cooked and then eaten was
> first replaced with packaged meat bought at a grocery store, has finally given
> way to the proliferation of packaged pre-cooked meals, where the natural
> ingredients have been obfuscated and abstracted into food products.

### 2

Whereas directly lived experience is a continuum of emotion and sensation, the
representational life is a stream of images detached from their living context.
The original context of this directly lived reality cannot be reestablished.
Living a representational life has a _completely separate_, but unified
experience unto itself that exists purely in thought. As reality is increasingly
represented as images to be experienced by sight alone, eventually a completely
_separate pseudo-world_ of images emerges—where the "real" reality is only
represented, but never actually experienced; merely performed and eventually
simulated. The horizon of this representational reality is one in which
individuals experience a representational world of fully autonomous non-lived
lives.

> "fully autonomous non-lived lives": The original French is "est le mouvement
> autonome du non-vivant." or "the autonomous movement of the non-living." c.f.
> Hegel, G., Harris, H. & Knox, T., 1979. The same reference is later made in
> thesis 215; the full quotation reads: "Need for labor, elevated into this
> universality, then form on their own account a monstrous system of community
> and mutual interdependence in a great people; the life of the dead body, that
> moves itself within itself, one which ebbs and flows in its motion blindly,
> like the elements, and which requires continual strict dominance and taming
> like a wild beast."

The Spectacle presents itself as a _universal way_ to provide representation of
directly lived reality, the so-called "official language of generalized
separation". Additionally, it is a separate part of society that establishes
common-ground between cultures and focuses all attention upon its spectacular
images of representational reality. The stream of images provides individuals
with common points of discussion and pseudo-connection. The stream of images
simultaneously connects and separates individuals. The spectacle connects
individuals to itself when oriented around the same topics, and atomizes
individuals into niche interest-groups of one, where they become alienated from
all those around them—trapped within an isolated pseudo-reality of personalized
information. Ultimately the spectacle is the official language that separates
individuals from one another.

> "spectacular images of representational reality": This stream of images
> includes television, radio, advertising, newsmedia, social media, and devices
> streaming personalized perspectives on reality.

> "common points of discussion and pseudo-connection": e.g. the office
> water-cooler discussion "Did you see last night's presidential debate?"; the
> banal talking points that offer no personal connection or relevance, but that
> act as mediator to relate to the spectacle rather than with other individuals.

### 4

The spectacle is not merely the apparatus of media, but the relations between
individuals themselves, as mediated by the stream of images that represent their
daily lived experience of this pseudo-reality.

### 5

The spectacle is not simply an overabundance of the media in everyday lived
experience. It is an ideology that has become materialized. This
ideology-materialized has replaced the lived experience of reality with a lived
experience of a representational pseudo-reality, one accepted as objective
truth.

### 6

The spectacle is both the product and producer of the contemporary form of
reality. It is not a supplement to, or decoration of reality, but the very heart
of pseudo-reality. It comes in many forms, entertainment, academic discourse,
education, news, advertisements, politics, dissent, and even common sense. It is
the hegemonic social culture, a _model_ for the prevailing way of life. The
spectacle self-validates its continued existence with the _continual
affirmation_ of its mode of production. Because it is continually reproduced, it
justifies its own creation and reaffirms its recreation. This guarantees both
its _permanent presence_ and its monopoly on time spent outside the modern
production process.

> "the very heart of pseudo-reality": c.f. Hegel, G., Wood, A. & Nisbet,
> H., 1991. The complete quotation reads "Religion is the sigh of the
> oppressed, the heart of a heartless world, the spirit of spiritless
> conditions." The original French here is "Il est le coeur de l'irréalisme de
> la société réelle" or directly translated: "It is the heart of the unrealism
> of real society." Debord uses different words to describe a fake reality, here
> choosing "l'irréalisme"/"unrealism". I have chosen to translate this as
> "pseudo-reality".

### 7

Social relationships are categorized into "real" social practice or an "image"
of social practice. Both practices contain the spectacle, distorting these
social activities to make the reproduction of the spectacle become the goal of
all social activity. The language of these social activities consists of _signs_
of the "ruling production" or the "indicators" of the most prestigious or
popular ways individuals relate to one another. The creation, recreation, and
adoption of these signs is the ultimate goal of this mode of production.

> "real" social practice / an "image" of social practice: To illustrate an
> example. the former may be in-person, face to face relationships between
> individuals _discussing the spectacle_, while the latter may be an image or
> representation of a relationship such as "Liking" selfies of friends on social
> media.

### 8

One cannot compare the directly lived experience of reality with the spectacle
because contemporary society and spectacle are one and the same. Directly lived
reality produces and absorbs the spectacle such that directly lived reality is
no longer something separate, it creates a totality in which reality exists on
both sides. As directly lived reality swings as a pendulum towards the
spectacle, it finds itself back where it started.

> "directly lived reality swings as a pendulum towards the spectacle": The
> original French is "Chaque notion ainsi fixée n'a pour fond que son passage
> dans l'opposé : la réalité surgit dans le spectacle, et le spectacle est
> réel." or as translated by Knabb: "Each of these seemingly fixed concepts has
> no other basis than its transformation into its opposite: reality emerges
> within the spectacle, and the spectacle is real."

### 9

With a world that is like a pendulum _swinging back and forth_ between directly
lived reality and the spectacle, the true is a moment of the false.

### 10

The concept of "the spectacle" explains many diverse phenomena. The recognition
of the spectacles ability to explain the diversity of this phenomenon is itself
part of the spectacle, as it organizes and _validates_ all social relations
according to appearances. When studied by itself, the spectacle is the
_affirmation_ that all human relationships are merely an image of relationship.
Any sufficient and total critique of the spectacle that grasps its underlying
nature reveals it as a complete _negation_ of life that presents an _appearance_
of life.

> "an image of relationship": This is to say, the superficial appearance of a
> relationship, but one devoid of any direct connection between individuals. For
> example, a Facebook or LinkedIn "friend" can be someone you've never met, nor
> even talked to.

> "a complete negation of life": The original French is " la négation visible de
> la vie". Life in the sense (and used elsewhere) of an individual's
> participation-in, and experience-of directly lived events, as opposed to mere
> spectacing or participation in virtual or vicarious events.

### 11

In order to describe the spectacle, it is necessary to artificially separate and
identify inseparable elements. When _analyzing_ the spectacle, it is necessary
to use the language of the spectacle in that we continue to operate within the
methodological terrain of the society that is expressed by the spectacle. The
spectacle is both the _zeitgeist_ and the _ultimate goal_ of this contemporary
arrangement of social life. The spectacle is the historical period in which we
are caught.

### 12

The spectacle presents itself as always positive, indisputable, and
inaccessible. Because it is always recreating and regenerating itself, and is
beyond dispute (generally accepted as common sense). It says nothing more than
"what appears is good, what is good appears." The passive acceptance it demands
is already imposed by its one-way dialog, a monopoly on the presentation of
appearances, which presents reality as it is, as it must be.

> "what appears is good, what is good appears.": c.f. Hegel, G., Wood, A. &
> Nisbet, H., 1991. The quote is: "What is rational is real, and what is real is
> rational."

### 13

The fundamentally indisputable, unchanging, and frozen nature of the spectacle
stems from how its means are its ends. It is the sun that never sets over the
empire of modern passivity. It covers the entire surface of the world and bathes
indefinitely in its own glory.

> "the sun that never sets over the empire...": The phrase "the empire on which
> the sun never sets" was applied to the Spanish Empire of the sixteenth century
> and later to the British Empire.

### 14

The society of modern industry is not accidentally or superficially spectacular
by nature, it is _fundamentally spectatorist_. The spectacle is the image of the
ruling economy. Its goal is nothing, its development everything. It has no goal
otherwise.

> "Its goal is nothing, its development everything": c.f. Bernstein, E., 1911.
> Full quote is "To me that which is generally called the ultimate aim of
> socialism is nothing, but the movement is everything."

### 15

The spectacle presents itself as an endless parade of new products, as a
repeating presentation of the systems self-validating rationale, and as an
economic system that outputs an increasing multitude of image-objects. The
spectacle itself is the _leading product_ of contemporary society.

### 16

The spectacle is able to subjugate human beings to itself because the economy is
its servant, having already subjugated them. The spectacle is the forcing
function for the development of the economy for its own desires. The spectacle
is a faithful reflection of the things produced opposed to a fictitious
reflection of the objectification of the producers.

> "a fictitious reflection of the objectification of the producers" The original
> French is "et l'objectivation infidèle des producteurs." This is to say, the
> spectacle faithfully presents itself whilst it distorts and hides the
> alienation and objectification of the individuals involved.

### 17

The result of the industrial revolution was the dominance of the economy over
all of social life, degrading life from a state of _being_ to a state of
_having_. The contemporary phase of post-industrial society has again shifted
from a state of _having_ to one of _appearing_. All actual "having" must now
draw its prestige and ultimate utility from appearances. All individual reality
depends on and draws its power from social reality. Individual reality is only
allowed to appear to the extent that it _is not actually real_.

> "degrading life from a state of being to a state of having": c.f. Marx, K. &
> Engels, F., 1988. Full quote: "Private property has made us so stupid and
> partial that an object is only ours when we have it, when it exists for us as
> capital or when it is directly eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc., in short,
> utilized in some way. But private property itself only conceives these various
> forms of possession as means of life, and the life for which they serve as
> means is the life of private property-labor and creation of capital. Thus all
> the physical and mental senses have been replaced by the simple alienation of
> all these senses-the sense of having."

### 18

When directly lived reality is replaced by a reality of representational images,
the images become real and motivate new desires and hypnotic behaviors. Since
the spectacle provides specific techniques of imagery to represent aspects of
reality, directly lived reality can no longer be understood, appreciated, or
even grasped. These images correspond to the human sense of sight, being the
most general way for the spectacle to represent reality. The spectacle cannot be
found by looking for it, nor even by listening for it. The spectacle escapes
projects to evade it, wherever there is independent _representation_, the
spectacle is reconstituted.

> "When directly lived reality is replaced by a reality of representational
> images, the images become real…": The original French is "Là où le monde réel
> se change en simples images, les simples images deviennent des êtres réels"
> c.f. Marx, K. & Engels, F., 2002 (Ch. VIII 3a), the full quote is: "For one to
> whom the sensuously perceptible world becomes a mere idea, for him mere ideas
> are transformed into sensuously perceptible beings…"

### 19

The spectacle is built upon the methodological traditions of western philosophy,
one that analyses reality in the limited terms of our sense of vision, and the
continual development of this observation-based form of rationality. Therefore,
the spectacle inherits the _weakness_ of those philosophical frameworks. As
such, the spectacle transforms directly lived reality into the mere observation
of reality (its image as a substitute for reality). The experience of directly
lived reality has been degraded to a life of _speculation_.

> "transforms directly lived reality into the mere observation of reality…": The
> French here is "Il ne réalise pas la philosophie, il philosophie la réalité."
> Directly translated as "it does not realize philosophy, it philosophizes
> reality". c.f. Marx, K., 1844 "you cannot supersede philosophy without
> realizing it". It is here the spectacle reaches its apogee, the complete
> reification of reality, one in which we have fundamentally mistaken the map
> for its territory.

### 20

Religion is the trend in which humanity attributes power and responsibility to a
source outside ourselves. Spectacular technology has not disproved or diminished
this trend, it only roots the source of power as centered upon Earth, recreating
the misattribution of power to technology, such that even the most basic acts of
daily life become abstract and alienated from directly lived reality.
Philosophy, the act of thinking outside of context, and the power it entails;
together with its contemplation of a power separate from humanity prevents it
from full emancipation from theology. The development of the spectacle does not
project a false paradise onto the heavens, instead offering the denial of life
on Earth, a false material reality _within ourselves_ but too sacred to
participate in or directly access.

> "can never supersede theology": In this context, theology is the study of how
> humanity places power in The Other and absolve themselves of responsibility to
> power.

### 21

As long as our desires are socially dreamed pseudo-needs, dreaming will remain
necessary. The spectacle is the nightmare of contemporary reality in which the
only way to achieve our dreams is to remain asleep. The spectacle is the Ambien®
that maintains that sleep.

> "The spectacle is the Ambien® that maintains that sleep": Original French here
> is "Le spectacle est le gardien de ce sommeil." or "The spectacle is the
> guardian of that sleep." c.f. Freud, S. & Brill, A., 1994 (Ch. 5, Section C),
> which contends that dreams reflect "the wish for sleep" and that "dreams are
> the guardians of sleep." Ambien is a sleep aid sold at most pharmacies.

### 22

Those in positions of practical power within contemporary society have detached
themselves from directly lived reality in order to focus on building practical
power in the new empire of the spectacle. This can be explained by their
continued lack of cohesion and the contradictions inherent in the exercise of
that power.

> "the contradictions inherent in the exercise of that power": c.f. Marx, K. &
> Engels, F., 1998. Full quotation is "But the fact that the secular basis
> detaches itself from itself and establishes itself as an independent realm in
> the clouds can only be explained by the divisions and contradictions within
> this secular basis." This is to say, the ruling classes have a purely
> ideological and oversimplified understanding of reality, and have shifted the
> exercise of power to the falsified realm of the spectacle. This idea is
> explored in depth in the 2016 documentary _HyperNormalisation_, in the quote
> "politicians, financiers and technological utopians, rather than face up to
> the real complexities of the world, retreated. Instead, they constructed a
> simpler version of the world in order to hang on to power." see Curtis,
> A., 2016.

### 23

The oldest social specialization is that of an individual in control of _power_
(e.g. the tribal chieftain). This specialization is at the root of the spectacle
and acts as the representative and decision-maker for all other activities in
society. It has banned all other acts of expression unless it is presented by
the spectacle. The most modern specialization is simultaneously the most
ancient.

> "an individual in control of power": With the development from
> hunter-gatherers to agrarian societies emerged the first specialization: the
> tribal chieftain.

> "most modern specialization is simultaneously the most archaic": c.f. Marx,
> K., 2005. Full quotation "[Some] determinations will be shared by the most
> modern epoch and the most ancient."

### 24

The spectacle is a self-congratulatory monologue with itself, describing its own
totalitarian management of the very conditions of existence. The seemingly
objective relationships between television, radio, advertisements, and social
media networks to the individuals who consume that media conceal the fact that
these are relationships between people, but appear as relationships between
classes. Humanity continually destroys our irrational yet actually existing
relationships and replaces them with a synthetic copy, a poor model built upon
the same deadly irrationalities as before. The spectacle is not a natural or
inevitable result of technological determinism, on the contrary, the spectacle
is a configuration of society that develops technology for its own sake.
Limiting the consideration of the spectacle to its most apparent and superficial
manifestation of the "mass media", it would seem to be imposed upon society as a
mere technical apparatus. It must be understood that this apparatus is not
neutral and that its development has progressed with respect to the demands of
the spectacle. If the social relationships of contemporary times can only be
facilitated by the mediation of instantaneous communication technologies, then
the administration of these technologies becomes a form of power; as such, this
"communication" is a _unilateral one-way dialog_. The continual consolidation
and accumulation of these technologies results is the accumulation of this
power. The control of communication in a one-way dialog to the passive consumer
reflects the division of social labor between the _state_ and the passive
citizen. These divisions are the primary tools of class domination, and provide
the model for a continual separation of all social relationships.

> spectacular relationships between classes and people.": c.f. Lukács, G., 1971.
> Full quotation is "The fetishistic illusions enveloping all phenomena in

> "…the division of social labor between the state and the passive citizen":

### 25

The spectacles primary power is its ability to _separate_. With the shift to
permanent agrarian societies came the institutionalization of the social
division of labor in the form of a permanent ruling class. This class was
legitimated by a form of thought borrowed from the earlier hunter-gatherer
period, namely the legitimization of power as bestowed by mythical power, the
same source from which every subsequent power has camouflaged itself. Religion
justifies the power of those in the ruling class as sacred, and excuses _their
failures_ by corresponding them to the ontological order of the heavens. In this
sense, all power bestowed by a social division of labor has been spectacular.
The adherence to a belief in this separate and frozen ruling class was largely
due to a general lack of regular, actual daily participation in social activity.
Contrary to the frozen order bestowed by the heavens, the spectacle promotes a
subset of real social activity, creating a false opposition between that which
is socially _possible_ against that which is socially _permitted_. The spectacle
maintains an unconsciousness about the real changes to the conditions of daily
life. The spectacle is self-perpetuating, it makes its own rules: It is the
contemporary pseudo-God. The spectacle makes no secret about what it is, namely,
a hierarchical power developing for its own sake. The spectacle drives the
division of labor into smaller, more specialized and efficient tasks until these
tasks can be automated by machines. This increasing specialization creates the
efficiencies required to sustain an ever-increasing global market. This
specialization is so niche that workers cannot see the context or even the
product of their labor, nor can they relate to other equally specialized workers
who attend to similar tasks. Due to this alienation between worker and task,
worker and worker, and worker to community, any and all shared sense of purpose
are eliminated, without a clear path to reunite either in solidarity or power.

> "a subset of real social activity": e.g. protest in its undirected, symbolic,
> and mostly pointless form, the promotion of various forms of non-violence.

> "The adherence to a belief in this separate ruling class… actual daily
> participation in social activity.": It wasn't until the emergence of cities,
> and the breakdown of serfdom where the peasant class could move into the
> cities, making it possible for the actual daily participation in social life.

### 26

The acceleration of the division of labor and the depth of specialization
increases the distance between the producer and the final product. This
simultaneously reduces communication between producers, and eliminates any sense
of accomplishment for the final product. As production processes are specialized
(and aspects of the labor are outsourced to even deeper specialists) the
organizer of labor continues to concentrate control over the entire production
process. The big-picture vision and control of organization over all aspects of
communication between vertical specialists become the only aspect of management.
The measure and goal of this system of alienation is the _proletarianization_ of
the entire world.

> "the proletarianization of the entire world.": This is to say, the global
> economic system is structured to shift the _monopolization of the
> understanding_ of the productive process to the ruling class, and to alienate
> the working class; first from their labor, the products of their labor, from
> each other, and finally from their community.

### 27

The success of division of labor and automation becomes the primary goal—the
production of the division of labor and automation—is the ends. In what was
previously associated with one's primary work, those whose jobs are on the
leading edge of elimination by automation are finding this time associated with,
and replaced with inactivity. This inactivity, however, is not free from
productive power. The inactivity of the jobless is dependent on the productive
output of the automated systems of production—namely in the form of consumption.
The necessity of maximum efficiency rationalizes the existence of a jobless
class, although it is recognized as an uneasy relationship. Individuals are
either directly contributing to the spectacle, or partaking in consuming its
output, but the spectacle has no space for _real_ activity outside this
arrangement. There is no "liberation from labor" or "increase in leisure" when
at any time an individual is either contributing-to or consuming-from the system
of production. None of the productive energy that was appropriated by the
spectacle can be regained by the consumption of the spectacle, it all
contributes to the development of the spectacle.

### 28

An economic system based on divisibility of labor continues to produce more
division in a _vicious cycle of isolation_. The technology based on the
isolation of concerns creates processes that further isolate. The automobile,
television—technologies _selected by the spectacle_ are also the weapons that
perpetuate the isolation that creates our "lonely crowd". Each technology
recreates the basis of the spectacle in ever more concrete terms.

> "automobile, television… ": Even more applicable is how the smartphone and the
> increasingly personalized nature of internet media contributes to increasingly
> isolating islands of perspective.

> "lonely crowd": An allusion to David Riesman's "The Lonely Crowd", see
> Riesman, D., Glazer, N., Denney, R. & Gitlin, T., 2001.

### 29

The spectacle originates from the alienation as a result of the division of
labor. The enormous growth of the spectacle expresses the total loss of a
unified perspective shared amongst individuals. All labor, specific techniques,
jobs, and skills are abstracted along with increasing abstraction of the overall
production process to the point where the ideas of _being concrete_ is itself an
_abstraction_. The spectacle _represents itself_ as a perfect image of the
world, a map or model of the world where the world is merely an instance of this
map. Spectators are connected no longer to one another, but solely by a one-way
relationship to the spectacle at the center. The spectacle connects the
separated, but it connects them only _in their separateness_.

> "The spectacle represents itself as a perfect image of the world… an instance
> of this map": The original French is "Dans le spectacle, une partie du monde
> se représente devant le monde, et lui est supérieure" or "It thus tends to
> divide society into two parts, one of which is superior to society." c.f.
> Marx, K. & Engels, F., 1998.

> "The spectacle connects the separated, but it connects them only in their
> separateness." c.f. Hegel, G., Knox, T. & Kroner, R., 1975. Full quotation "In
> love the separate does still remain, but as something united and no longer as
> something separate;"

### 30

The spectacor of the spectacle cannot escape alienation by unconscious or
conscious thinking. The more he/she contemplates the spectacle and his/her place
within it, the less he/she lives in directly experienced reality. Conversely,
the more he/she passively accepts living in a spectacular reality the less
he/she understands of real existence and the source of their desire. The
individual no longer performs their own actions, but sees them performed by
another. This is why the spectator no longer feels like they participate
directly in lived reality, and feels at home nowhere, as the spectacle is
everywhere.

> "but sees them performed by another" Performance can take the form of
> spectating upon celebrities playing sports, actors enacting love in film, or
> his/her own video game avatar performing their actions vicariously in a
> virtual environment.

> "The more he/she contemplates… the less he/she lives": c.f. Marx, K. & Engels,
> F., 1988. Full quotation: "The more the worker exerts himself in his work, the
> more powerful becomes the world of objects that he brings into being over
> against himself, and the poorer his inner world becomes, and the less he
> belongs to himself … The greater his activity, the less he possesses"

### 31

Workers do not produce their own circumstances, they produce an autonomous force
of alienation independent of themselves. The _success_ of this production, and
the abundance of autonomous power it generates, is experienced as an _abundance
of disposession_. Under the regime of the spectacle, workers earn wages in order
to buy more products that further dispossess them of directly lived experience
and instead substitute it with objects that make lived experience _foreign_ to
them. The spectacle is a map of this alienated reality, one which is identical
to and yet obscures the real world. The map _shows us_ what we've missed in high
definition detail.

> "Workers do not produce their own circumstances… independent of themselves":
> c.f. Marx, K. & Engels, F., 1988, full quotation is "The alienation of the
> worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object, an
> external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently of him and
> alien to him, and begins to confront him as an autonomous power; that the life
> he has bestowed on the object confronts him as a hostile and alien force."

> "The spectacle is a map of this alienated reality, one which is identical to
> and yet obscures the real world." An allusion to Alfred Korzybski's phrase,
> "The map is not the territory."

### 32

The spectacle is a concrete manufacturer of alienation. Economic expansion is
the product of the increased demand for alienation-production. What grows with
the growth of the economy is the very alienation that exists as its basis.

### 33

As systems of production specialize, and each worker is more alienated from the
final product, and while they produce ever finer details of things in that
world, they increasingly find themselves separated from participation in daily
life. The closer their life seems to be at their own direction, the more they
find themselves alienated from that life.

> "The closer their life seems to be at their own direction… alienated from that
> life": This thesis is more relevant with the recent development of "social
> media influencers", those individuals who curate an image of their lives
> online, only to find themselves forced to continually reproduce an image of a
> life they no longer actually live: commodifying themselves in a process that
> alienates themselves from lived experience. Their lives are a labor of
> self-alienation.

### 34

The spectacle is _capital_ extended to such an accumulation that it becomes a
substitute for reality itself.

> "a substitute for reality itself": Original French "qu'il devient image." or
> "where it becomes image."
