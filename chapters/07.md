### 165

Capitalist production has become ubiquitous, all military, political, and trade
barriers between societies have been broken down, there is no longer an outside
to Capitalism. This is an extensive and intensive process of _trivialization_ of
unique local customs, traditions, methods, languages, and cultures. These local
distinctions are commoditized and _banalized_ for consumption by the global
market. This created a universal space of the global market, where local goods,
cultures and the places themselves are made accessible to the market, each
comparable and homogeneous to better conform to the ease of exchange—therefore
bankrupt of its once unique character. The corporate restrictions on craft
guilds of the Middle Ages assuring the _quality_ of craft production had to be
destroyed to make way for the era of mass production, just as it had to dissolve
the autonomy and quality of _places_[
  "it had to dissolve the autonomy and quality of places": This can be seen
  happening everywhere simultaneously, with the reproduction of the same banal
  streets, stores, languages, restaurants, styles, and customs across the
  globe—the "airbnb-ification" of the world. See Chayka, K., 2016.

The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it
batters down all Chinese walls[
  "The cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it
  batters down all Chinese walls": From the original French: <q lang="fr">Cette
  puissance d'homogénéisation est la grosse artillerie qui a fait tomber toutes
  les murailles de Chine.</q> This is a direct reference to _The Communist
  Manifesto_, see Marx, K., Engels, F. & Jones, G. 2002 (Part 1)
]{#fn165.2 .sidenote}.

### 166

It is in order to become ever more identical to itself, to get as close as
possible to unchanging monotony, that the _free space of the commodity_ is
henceforth at all times modified and reconstructed.

### 167

The spectacular society gradually eliminates geographic distance, it
simultaneously replaces it with new internal distances in the form of
spectacular separation[
  "spectacular separation": Society is making travel more efficient while making
  places more homogeneous, simultaneously making places irrelevant with
  technologies such as remote work, video conferencing, and virtual reality—the
  artificial images used as substitutes for reality itself. These geographic
  distances are then recreated in the form of spectacular separation—the direct
  experiences such as community, people, places, events and lives people were
  previously living are increasingly substituted with ephemeral recreations and
  cheap copies as our new lived reality, alienating us from directly lived
  experiences and creating divisions within communities and even families.
]{#fn167.1 .sidenote}.

### 168

As a by-product of the circulation of consumer goods, tourism, the circulation
of people as consumption, is fundamentally reduced to the leisure of going to
see what has become banal. The application of business-style management
techniques to travel guarantees the _equivalence_ of places. The same
modernization that has removed time from travel has also removed the reality of
place.

### 169

Society has developed its own techniques for the task of molding the natural
landscape it finds itself within. Urbanism[
  Urbanism: The French word <q lang="fr">urbanisme</q> means "city planning"
  which has an impersonal and bureaucratic connotation. Broadly encompassing
  urban planning, real-estate development, and gentrification.
]{#fn169.1 .sidenote}
is capitalism's direct mode of
appropriation of natural and human environments. This capital appropriation
gradually evolves towards absolute domination of the environment—in the form of
the densely packed urban city. Urbanism continues to expand, eventually remaking
the totality of the landscape into its _own elaborately decorated stage_.

### 170

The drive to urbanization is an imperative of capitalism, this drive results in
"a freezing of life"[
  "A freezing of life": A static world devoid of spontaneity, the result of land
  development and bureaucratic zoning laws optimized for rent seeking and
  increased land valuations, devoid of nature—where its residents have no
  ability to change their surroundings to suit daily life. All desire for change
  is eliminated in order to serve the profit generating imperative of capital,
  all autonomy of local residential use is therefore foreclosed, instead
  privileging real estate development as the only legitimate use. The result of
  this is a predominance of land organized around the valuable placement of real
  estate objects over the living use and alteration of land by the very people
  who live in these spaces, people who wish to change their surroundings over
  time as use-patterns and ways of living change with the seasons and with time.
  For more on this see 0xADADA, 2019 (April 16).
]{#fn170.1 .sidenote}.
Described by Hegel as a predominance of "the peaceful
coexistence of space"[
  "The peaceful coexistence of space": This quote has been changed from the
  original: "The Object thus posited as outside the subject and in its own self
  as an externality is partly the quiescent side-by-sideness of space, partly a
  restless becoming in the successive moments of time. Space and time are
  abstract intuitions or Universal Forms of Intuition." Quote taken from Hegel,
  G.W.F., 1986 (Pp. 151 No. 136).
]{#fn170.2 .sidenote}
over "a restless becoming in successive moments of time."

### 171

The technical apparatus of the forces of capitalism (television, social media,
government policy, and consumer products) should be understood as the tools of
separation: grouping people into exclusionary tribes as well as alienating
people from their labor and environment—exclusion from participation in daily
life. The technical apparatus of urbanization is the fundamental method that
makes all others possible—and far more efficient. Urbanization is the creation
and preparation of the territory upon which all other technical methods are then
deployed. It is the very _technology of separation_.

### 172

Urbanism is the modern method that satisfies the need to safeguard class power.
This method preserves the atomization of each worker that the urban conditions
of production had dangerously _brought together_. The continual struggle of
capital against the organization of the labor force to improve their working
conditions has found urbanism to be its most effective field of operation. Ever
since the street-by-street battles fought in Paris by the Communards of the
French Revolution, those in power have improved their methods of maintaining
order on the streets, eventually resulting in the suppression of the streets
themselves[
  "…eventually resulting in the suppression of the streets themselves": Between
  1853 and 1870 the French Emperor Napoleon III commissioned Georges-Eugène
  Haussmann to destroy the neighborhoods that were the very heart of the French
  Revolution: namely from the Quartier des Arcis to the Hôtel de Ville,
  including Île de la Cité, transforming these areas into broad avenues wide
  enough for an army to march down.
]{#fn172.1 .sidenote}.
In his book _The City in History_, Lewis Mumford describes a
"one-way system" whereby "the present means of long-distance mass communication,
sprawling isolation has proved an even more effective method of keeping a
population under control" (Mumford, L., 1961). This system empowers the ruling
class to broadcast their historical perspectives and ideologies to an alienated
society who no longer has an ability to respond with its own voice or even
amongst each other. Urbanism is the general trend, a global movement to
isolation within the crowd, a sense of "_being alone, together_," but in service
to the needs of corporate production—we are isolated to the greatest extent
allowable to maximize production and consumption. The greatest examples of how
urbanism isolates us together is in the factories, cultural centers (museums,
theaters, etc), vacation resorts, and housing developments[
  "vacation resorts, and housing developments": The planned, gated residential
  community "Celebration" in Osceola County, Florida which was developed by The
  Walt Disney Company is an example of a pseudo-community where both vacation
  and housing developments converge. The community is primarily separated from
  society by gates, and each household is carefully separated from the others by
  heavily manicured landscaping—a type of hostile architecture leaving all
  shared community space to become de facto dead zones of inactivity.
]{#fn172.2 .sidenote}—all explicitly
oriented to the goal of creating pseudo-community. The dominant imperative of
atomizing isolation follows the individual into the family unit, where each
member is in their own room, each isolated by their own personalized television,
music, and internet entertainment that are so particular to the individual that
sharing common entertainment interests becomes increasingly more difficult—and
therefore more isolating. The more isolated the individual becomes, the more
dominant the images of spectacular society become[
  "The more isolated the individual becomes, the more dominant the images of
  spectacular society become": This is to say, the individual is most vulnerable
  to the dominating one-way conversation of the mass media when they are alone,
  and unable to relate what they see in the media to their isolated experience
  of daily life. The increase of media outlets and the explosion of personalized
  streaming sites like Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, etc, make our television
  habits increasingly unrelatable (meanwhile experimental television formats
  like "Bandersnatch" point to the horizon of personalized media in which the
  actual content of any single episode is personalized for each individual.) For
  more on how Netflix is transforming personalized media, see 0xADADA, 2021
  (January 14)
]{#fn172.3 .sidenote}
and this is where the spectacle acquires its full potential.

### 173

Prior to the 20^th^ century, innovations in architecture were exclusively
designed to serve the interests of the ruling class. Now, for the first time,
architectural innovations are aimed directly _at the poor_. Architects no longer
build ornate, unique places but merely reproduce aesthetically bankrupt habitats
characterized by their _mass_: mass-produced for 'the masses', dictated by the
contemporary conditions of production.

  ](images/al-ain.jpg)

At the core of these conditions are an _authoritarian decision making process_
by which a corporation, driven by the profit imperative, works with the local
municipality to abstract a local environment into an interchangeable space of
abstraction. This type of architecture develops the same anywhere in the world:
the buildings use the same designs and trendy materials no matter where they
are, and the same international businesses soon arrive to service the
communities (e.g. McDonald's, Starbucks, etc.) This works especially well in
undeveloped countries, which are their most fertile terrain. This process is
most efficient when a society's material power is inversely proportional to its
_lack of progress_ to appropriate social control of this power. The delay of the
conscious appropriation of urbanism corresponds equally with the power of
thermonuclear weapons and genetic bioengineering (where genetically engineered
human life is already possible.)

### 174

We live in the era of the destruction of the organic urban environment by an
urbanism that is exploding the city, littering the countryside with what Lewis
Mumford calls "a formless mass of thinly spread semi-urban tissue"[
  "a formless mass of thinly spread semi-urban tissue": Quote from Mumford, L.,
  1961 (Ch. 16.6, Pp. 508).
]{#fn174.1 .sidenote}. This
explosion is exemplified by strip malls, restaurant franchises, and landscapes
developed to serve the required efficiencies of automobile-oriented
consumption[
  "landscapes developed only to serve the required efficiencies of
  automobile-oriented consumption": For an in-depth analysis on the subject of
  suburbanization, see Duany, A., Zyberk, E. & Speck, J., 2010. James Howard
  Kunstler gave an insightful and funny TED talk on the topic called _The
  ghastly tragedy of the suburbs_, see Kunstler, J. H., 2004.
]{#fn174.2 .sidenote}.
This is the dictatorship of the automobile, where all designs create landscapes
to serve vehicles, not animals nor human pedestrians. The automobile, arguably
the first example of a product produced during the first stage of commodity
abundance, has come to reconfigure the human environment of the city with the
dominating imperatives of speed and available parking space to create a
centrifugal trend moving gradually away from the city into any nearby
countryside with "undeveloped" space. The dominating force of the highway
dislocated the historical, organic city centers and instead promoted an
ever-growing flat expanse[
  "an ever-growing flat expanse": Cities like Los Angeles or Las Vegas are the
  perfect examples of sprawling automobile oriented cities.
]{#fn174.3 .sidenote}.
Meanwhile, the countryside is developed ad-hoc around
temporary "distribution factories"—poor copies of the urban centers of exchange,
alienated from the street and the land around them by acres of ample parking
space. Even then, these temples of conspicuous consumption themselves become
victims of the centrifugal trend of suburban expansion, becoming congested and
then likewise abandoned or reconfigured. This gradual process of centrifugal
reconfiguration of the urban and suburban environment is the sign that the city
is gradually _consuming itself_.

### 175

Economic history has developed upon the presumption of an opposition between the
town and the country, creating a race to equilibrium such that a distinction
between the two have all but disappeared. The current _paralysis_ of historical
development, the so-called "End of History" where irreversible historical time
refuses to progress[
  "where irreversible historical time refuses to progress": See commentary on
  [thesis 145](#ref145.1).
]{#fn175.1 .sidenote}—privileging
the development of the independent goals of the
spectacular economy, which comes at the expense of all other pursuits. This has
resulted in the disappearance of both town and country instead of their
_transcendence_. This is most clearly visible as bits and pieces of both urban
and rural life are strewn about the landscape, each eroding the other into
smooth and undifferentiated zones that are neither urban or rural, but have come
to dominate the developed regions of the world.

### 176

The emergent power of the city has made a universal history possible—those
events and recorded stories which is accessible to all people. Universal history
emerged at the moment the city became predominant and ruled over the country.
Marx considered one of the greatest revolutionary merits of the bourgeoisie was
that it "subjected the country to the towns"[
  "subjected the [rule of the] country to the [rule of the] towns": Quote C.f.
  Marx, K., Engels, F. & Jones, G., 2002 (Part 1).
]{#fn176.1 .sidenote},
whose "very air is liberating"[
  "very air is liberating": Quote is from the German saying
  <q lang="de">Stadtluft macht frei</q> or "city air liberates" a medieval
  German saying, expressing how serfs could free themselves from their ties to
  the landed gentry by escaping to the towns.
]{#fn176.2 .sidenote}.
While the history of the city is also the site for the historical struggle for
freedom, it has yet to host its victory. It is also a history of the tyranny of
a state administration of both city and country. The city is the _focal point of
history_ because it is a concentrator of social power, which makes the
historical enterprise possible, as well as an awareness of the past, a universal
historical consciousness. The present trend of the city consuming itself is a
symptom of the spectacular economy retarding the unification of a society of
people attaining freedom and a universal historical consciousness—one that will
enable society to overcome the totality of its alienation.

### 177

"The country demonstrates just the opposite fact: isolation and separation"[
  "The country demonstrates just the opposite fact: isolation and separation":
  see Marx, K. & Engels, F., 1998. (Ch. 1 Part 4, Section 2).
]{#fn177.1 .sidenote} (as
opposed to the city, which mixes and brings people together). As urbanism
consumes the city, it replaces it with a _pseudo-countryside_ devoid of any
attachment to nature or the social aspects of either traditional farming
villages or the mixtures of culture apparent in the organic city have been lost.
This new condition of "urban redevelopment", that densely packed and yet
separate and isolated environments produces a new artificial peasantry. These
new peasants are molded by their physical conditions and the influence of the
spectacle: where once peasants were isolated by physical distance now find
architectural separation, and where simple ignorance once reigned, instead
reigns the blinding influence of the spectacular image which recreates a
simplemindedness in the new peasantry. These forces, both historical and
contemporary prevent the peasantry from unifying and taking action in their own
best interests, to become conscious of their own responsibility as the creative
historical force within society. Peasants in fact create this world, but the
lies and artificiality of the spectacle continue to credit the elite; thus to
seize control of society and the responsibility for its creation seems just as
beyond their reach as it was for those living in an agrarian society to seize
control of the natural rhythms and cycles of their labor. The agrarians lived
according to a cyclical time controlled by nature, but contemporary
pseudo-cyclical time is controlled by society itself. The traditional agrarian
peasantry was the basis for the "asiatic mode of production" as exemplified by
the Chinese state bureaucracy, a form of "oriental despotism"[
  "oriental despotism": See Wittfogel, K., 1981. More recently, 
  Žižek has identified a shift from authoritarian despotism to an emergent form
  of capitalism he calls "Capitalism with Asian Values". See Žižek , S., 2010.
]{#fn177.2 .sidenote} which, because of
its wide dispersion across geography, necessitated a heavily centralized
bureaucracy. The neo-peasantry, which has emerged from the material conditions
of the pseudo-country combined with the mental influence of the spectacle
differs from the traditional peasantry in that their simplemindedness,
ignorance, and _apathy_ to seize power has to be maintained in the present as
well as _historically manufactured_. Simple ignorance has been replaced by the
organized spectacle of falsehoods[
  "the organized spectacle of falsehoods": A rewording of the original French,
  <q lang="fr">l'ignorance naturelle a fait place au spectacle organisé de
  l'erreur</q> or a "natural ignorance has given way to the organized spectacle
  of error". The original phrasing was very abstract, I've tried to clarify that
  it is specifically about the lies and exclusions of the media. Late capitalism
  has reformed education by exclusion, to such an extent that it increasingly
  moves resources away from history, the arts, health & fitness, and the
  humanities. Instead, it focuses on STEM subjects and a vocational style of
  education most well suited to producing a specialized, short lived—and
  therefore disposable workforce rather than a civic-minded citizenry producing
  a public good.
]{#fn177.3 .sidenote}.
These "new cities" of pseudo-countryside, the
urbanized but consumed cities where the new pseudo-peasantry reside are the
clearest symptoms of a complete break from the historical time upon which they
were founded. These places continually distance themselves with their own past
and create an unchanging continuous present. Their motto may well be: "On this
site nothing will ever happen, and _nothing ever has_." This is all the result,
obviously, because the liberation of historical consciousness has not yet
occurred in these cities. Instead, we see the uncontrolled proliferation of the
force of _historical absence_, which begins to compose its own exclusionary
landscape.

### 178

A consciousness of history that threatens the spectacle is to discover the force
capable of reappropriating the environment for lived time[
  "reappropriating the environment for lived time": The force of a consciousness
  of history can reintroduce society and individuals to actual lived reality, a
  reality that enables participation in the events of one's own contemporary
  time and makes the local environment conducive to living fully engaged social
  lives.
]{#fn178.1 .sidenote}.
The proletarian
revolution is the _critique of human geography_[
  "critique of human geography": See more on human geography: Knabb, K., 2006
  (Pp. 1-14, 62-66, 69-73, 86-89).
]{#fn178.2 .sidenote},
a critique of the environments,
and social relationships that individuals are forced to navigate. Through
revolutionary acts and events, individuals and communities must construct
environments, events, and social relationships to provide the basis of an
autonomous control of not only their own labor, but their entire history—thus
creating a reality of their own. Revolution opens physical and social space to a
new and dynamic mobile space of play, where the rules of play are informal,
dynamic and freely chosen[
  "space of play, where the rules of play are informal, dynamic and freely
  chosen": Later in life, Debord formally explored the concept of 'play', and
  most concretely, he and his wife, Alice Becker-Ho, developed a table-top game
  called <q lang="fr">Le Jeu de la Guerre</q> or _A Game of War_. Debords'
  exploration of play as it applies to his game as well as its revolutionary use
  against neoliberal capitalism is examined in Barbrook, R. 2014.
]{#fn178.3 .sidenote}.
These open societies liberate authoritarian spaces,
and in the process rediscover the previously independent and unique character of
places without making them exclusive. This is accomplished without the
attachment to the land and agrarian ties to cyclical time, it is an unattached,
free space determined by its own egalitarian and parallel historical times,
where many chronologies are all available and equally valid. This returns
society to an authentic way of experiencing directly lived reality, and thus
brings back the authenticity of _travel_, and of life understood as a journey of
one's own creation with its own meaning.

### 179

The most revolutionary idea about urban development hasn't emerged from
urbanism, technology, nor from aesthetics. It is the decision to reconstruct the
environment according to the needs of power vested with the workers councils.
The environment will be configured by the _anti-state dictatorship_ of the
proletariat[
  "anti-state dictatorship of the proletariat": Debord specifically chose the
  phrase <q lang="fr">la dictature anti-étatique du prolétariat</q> to cut
  through the ambiguities of Marx's dictatorship of the proletariat, implemented
  by Stalin as a dictatorship _over_ the proletariat. His wording makes it very
  clear that he envisages a distinctly non-state form of social organization.
]{#fn179.1 .sidenote}—a generalized and collective form of self-management of
aligned individuals working together to create a public good, a "generalized
self-management"[
  "generalized self-management": A Situationist term for the form of
  self-governance elsewhere called the "anti-state dictatorship of the
  proletariat". See Raoul Vaneigem's _Notice to the Civilized Concerning
  Generalized Self-Management_ in Knabb, K., 2006 (Pp. 363-371).
]{#fn179.2 .sidenote}
according to the needs of the collective. The power of the
workers councils can only be realized and effective if it has the ambition to
transform the totality of existing conditions. It cannot assign itself trivial
reformist policy or any lesser task than the total transformation of existing
conditions if it is to be recognized and _to recognize itself_ in a world of its
own making.
