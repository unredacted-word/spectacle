description:
  "Debord describes and critiques the way we live. The power in these ideas lies
  in their ability to question, identify, and name the common assumptions of the
  present. Developing the concept of The Spectacle, he describes the ‚Äúgaze‚Äù of
  contemporary society. From its publication just before, and ultimately
  influencing the May 1968 revolt in Paris and Occupy Wall Street, this book
  continues to transform a wide range of progressive philosophical and political
  movements, most notably anti-capitalism, postmodernism, marxism, and
  anarchism."
