The [time of production]{.ix data-ix="time, of production"}—commodified
time, that time which has been segmented, allocated, where every interval is
equivalent in value and therefore
indistinguishable. The time of production produces an infinite accumulation of
these fungible intervals of time that are [equivalent without
equality]{.ix data-ix="equivalence without equality"}. This effectively renders
[irreversible time]{.ix} into
[abstract]{.ix data-ix="abstraction"} units, of which each segment must prove on
the stopwatch their quantitative equality. These abstracted units of time are,
in reality, merely their [use value]{.ix data-ix="value, use"} in
_exchangeability_. According to
this regime of social-control by commoditized time—"time is everything, man is
nothing; at best he is the carcass of time."[
  "time is everything, man is nothing…": See Marx, K., 1995 (Ch. 1, Sec­tion 2).
]{#fn147.1 .fn}
This is a complete devaluation of time—an inversion of the idea that time is the
space in which human society grows and blossoms into the "terrain of human
development".[
  "terrain of human development": See Marx, K. 2005 (Ch. 13).
]{#fn147.2 .fn .ix data-ix="terrain;development, human"}

### 148

To complement the [time of production]{.ix data-ix="time, of production"}—the
time of human non-development, is _[consumable
time]{.ix data-ix="time, consumable"}_. Consumable time is returned to social
life as a by-product of the time of production. It is experienced as
_[pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix data-ix="time, pseudo-cyclical see pseudo-cyclical
time;pseudo-cyclical time"}_.

### 149

[Pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix data-ix="pseudo-cyclical time"} is in fact the time
of production _disguised_ as time to be consumed freely by the workers.
Pseudo-cyclical time exhibits the same characteristics as the [time of
production]{.ix data-ix="time, of production"}, namely equally segmented,
fungible units of time; the qualitative dimensions of which are suppressed in
favor of quantitative equality. Since this pseudo-cyclical time is a
complementary by-product of the time of production, _it must maintain the
hegemony and legitimacy of the time of production_[
  "it must maintain the hegemony and legitimacy of the time of production": This
  is a significant rewording from the original French, which reads
  <q lang="fr">Mais étant le sous-produit de ce temps destiné à l'arriération de
  la vie quotidienne concrète</q>. This was translated by Knabb as "But as a
  byproduct of commodified time whose function is to promote and maintain the
  backwardness of everyday life". My translation abandons the "backwardness of
  everyday life" wording used in translations by both Knabb and Nicholson-Smith.
  I've attempted to clarify how the time of production is privileged over the
  subservient role of pseudo-cyclical time. See Debords' _Perspectives for
  Conscious Changes in Everyday Life_ for more on the "colonization" of everyday
  life, see Knabb, K., 2006 (Pp. 90-99).
]{#fn149.1 .fn}
as the [colonizer]{.ix data-ix="colonization, of time"} of time itself, in which
consumable time is relegated to the subservient role as gift rather than as
equal. To maintain these complementary roles, pseudo-cyclical time necessarily
finds itself laden with false attributions of value,[
  "false attributions of value": E.g. That the weekend is more valuable than the
  weekdays, the general sentiment that Mondays are worse than Fridays. These
  moments of time are perceived to be more valuable since the worker is able to
  consume this time freely.
]{#fn149.2 .fn}
and these moments are segmented into a sequence of artificially distinct
[events]{.ix}, which are merely undifferentiated moments of time
[perceived]{.ix data-ix="perception"} to be more highly valuable.

### 150

[Pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix data-ix="pseudo-cyclical time"} is the contemporary
equivalent to the time spent [surviving]{.ix data-ix="survival"} in
nature—foraging for food, searching for shelter, but in the contemporary
milieu—shopping, chores, and conducting economic transactions. Under both of
these regimes, daily life is devoid of decisions, while under pseudo-cyclical
time the individual is no longer bound to the natural order, but instead bound
to the economic [consumerist-nature]{.ix data-ix="consumerism"} thus created by
[alienated]{.ix data-ix="alienation"} labor. Thus, pseudo-cyclical time returns
to the same _natural_ cyclical rhythms that regulated the survival of
pre-industrial societies. It builds upon the vestiges of ancient
[cyclical time]{.ix data-ix="cyclical time"}, using it as a foundation and
generating new variations: day and night, weekly work and weekend rest, and the
cycle of harvest [festivals]{.ix data-ix="festivals"}, holidays, and
[vacations]{.ix data-ix="vacation"}.

![ ](images/time-and-history.png){.figure-1}

### 151

[Pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix data-ix="pseudo-cyclical time"} is a time that has
been _transformed by industry_.[
  "a time that has been transformed by industry": The way individuals spend
  consumable time is determined by industries whose sole output is the creation
  of ever-new consumable entertainments and activities: packaged vacations,
  films, video games, television series, social media, etc.
]{#fn151.1 .fn}
This time is itself a consumable [commodity]{.ix data-ix="commodities"}, one
which has combined all aspects of a social life which were previously
distinguished: private life, economic life, and political life. This combined
consumable time of contemporary society is the raw material to be consumed by
the worker how they see fit, but only as input to a set of ever-expanding
products on the market of socially controlled schedules.  "A product that
already exists in a form suitable for consumption may nevertheless serve as raw
material for some other product."[
  "A product that already exists… other product": C.f. Marx, K., Mandel, E.,
  Fowkes, B. & Fernbach, D., 1978. (Vol. I, Ch. 7, Section 1). As the worker
  earns more vacation time the longer they stay at a company, this additional
  time must be then used to consume new films, new television series, and new
  hobbies that mandate the consumption of new equipment. Thus this "free time"
  becomes pseudo-cyclical time—a consumable commodity that is the raw material
  for the generation of new products and commodities.
]{#fn151.1 .fn}

### 152

In the most developed sectors of [concentrated
capitalism]{.ix data-ix="spectacle, concentrated;capitalism"}, the market
creates "all inclusive" packaged experiences, which constitutes a single unified
[commodity]{.ix data-ix="commodities"}, thus increasing the number of diverse
commodities. This is made possible by the increase and ubiquity of the
[services]{.ix} and hospitality [economy]{.ix}, the increase of [leisure]{.ix}
activities, and the "all-inclusive" [luxury]{.ix} accomodations with pre-set
[vacation]{.ix} itineraries. This spectacular form of leisure even extends
to socialization as well, with the inclusion of "exciting conversations" and
"[celebrity]{.ix} meet & greet" [events]{.ix}. These types of events would not
be taken seriously without a corresponding [impoverishment]{.ix} of the
realities they parody. Obviously, these commodities reflect the advancement in
sales techniques in that they can be bought with credit.

### 153

Consumable [pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix} is [spectacular
time]{.ix data-ix="time, spectacular"}. In the most narrow sense, it is the time
allocated to the consumption of images,[
  "time allocated to the consumption of images…": Debord limits the conception
  of consumable time to the consumption of images, but his meaning of "images"
  can be interpreted loosely to include the consumption of films, newspapers and
  magazines, advertisements in all their forms, video games, social media, and
  any representative form of consumable media, products and services, and
  mediated experience.
]{#fn153.1 .fn}
more broadly it is the conception of time itself as a consumable commodity (a
[representation]{.ix} of moments of time perceived as having more intrinsic
value than the time of production, the so-called "real life" the worker must
endure.) This consumable time is increasingly allocated to the consumption of
[images]{.ix} (images which in turn serve as
[advertisements]{.ix data-ix="advertising"} for all other commodities),
deepening our immersion in the [spectacle]{.ix}. This time is the realm of the
commodity, and the images are the medium with which these commodities act upon
our [consciousness]{.ix} most efficiently. This realm is the chosen battlefield
from which the spectacular commodity mounts its strongest attack. The ultimate
goal of this attack is to maintain our [attention]{.ix} upon the spectacle
itself, and to increase the time allocated to the consumption of
[pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix} within the spectacle. This battlefield is at
once the locus of the spectacle, the center of its operation, and the most
exemplary form of all consumption. The [fetishization]{.ix data-ix="commodity
fetishism"} of time-saving products and services so sought after by contemporary
society, whether in the increasing speeds of cars, the speed and convenience of
online shopping, pre-made or instant meal replacements,[
  "pre-made or instant meal replacements": Debord uses the phrase
  <q lang="fr">ou de l'usage des potages en sachets</q> or "the use of instant
  soup". Most recently
  there's been an explosion in home meal delivery kits such as HelloFresh, Blue
  Apron, and Sun Basket. As for instant meal replacements, look no further than
  Soylent, the minimalist liquid meal which I myself must admit to drinking. I
  described my rationale for drinking it in _Hacking Life_: "[Soylent] allows
  Ron to simplify: to save on time (shopping, cooking, and cleaning), money (it
  is an inexpensive source of nutrients), and waste (it can keep for weeks)."
  see Reagle, J., 2019 (Pp. 102). I'm actually drinkng Chocolate Soylent while
  editing this note because it doesn't make a mess of my keyboard. Would Debord
  be ashamed, or would he understand that we're all continually subject to the
  Spectacle?
]{#fn153.2 .fn}
and the explosion of "fast-casual" restaurants all contribute to the increased
time spent consuming images. In the [United States]{.ix}, Americans end up
watching [television]{.ix} three to six hours per day. The social aspect of
consumable time is dominated by moments of [leisure]{.ix} and
[vacation]{.ix}s—moments which are presented as fleeting, _exclusive and
distant_, therefore desirable by definition, like any spectacular commodity.
These moments are simultaneously presented as separate from daily life and yet
more exemplary as moments of real authentic experience. These authentic moments
are supposed to be looked-forward to, whose cyclical return is to be expected.
But it is within these authentic, privileged moments that are supposedly more
real than daily life, what is in fact being produced is a more intensified
version of the spectacle: a [personalized]{.ix data-ix="personalization"},
lived, spectacular event. Thus, what has been portrayed as an authentic life
turns out to be merely a life more _authentically spectacular_.

### 154

The contemporary period of spectacular time presents itself as a time made up of
many frequently recurring [festivals]{.ix}, it is actually a period without
festivities. During the period of [cyclical time]{.ix}, the festival was a
frequent and luxurious experience of communal participation in life, now
impossible in a society without communities or luxury. These pseudo-parties,
poor parodies of gift exchange and Jubilee[
  Jubilee: A periodic festival of general debt-forgiveness, and often included
  the freeing of both slaves and prisoners. See Graeber, D. 2011.
]{#fn154.1 .fn .ix data-ix="jubilee"}
typical of [festivals]{.ix} of the previous period have been vulgarized into a
surplus of expenditure, but this expenditure only results in an expanding amount
of disappointment; a disappointment centered upon the promise of the next
pseudo-festival, one just as equally sure to disappoint. Under the reign of the
[spectacle]{.ix}, the lower the [use value]{.ix data-ix="value, use"} (e.g.
moments of leisure or pure inactive boredom) placed on time, the more highly
cherished this time becomes as it is experienced as a more authentic time of
real life. The reality of time has been replaced by the _advertisement_ of
spectacular time.

### 155

In ancient [agrarian societies]{.ix data-ix="agrarian society"}, the passing of
[cyclical time]{.ix} was perceived as the passage of their labors in sync with
the natural transition of the seasons. In contrast, the consumption of
[pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix} during the contemporary period of spectacular time
is in [contradiction]{.ix} with [the time of production—which is motionless; its
history has reached a stable, unchanging
conclusion]{#ref155.1 .ix data-ix="perpetual present"} while pseudo-cyclical
time has cycles, and continues to allow change and lets the participants write
their _own_ history in a [linear progression of
time]{.ix data-ix="time, linear"}. The cyclical time of the agrarian period was
motionless with its repetitive [illusion]{.ix data-ix="illusions"} of
cyclicality, but the events of these cycles were authentically experienced. 
Spectacular time is the progression of linear time[
  "Spectacular time is the progression of linear time…": The original French is
  a beautifully worded example of Debords' use of détournement, so I've included
  it here: <q lang="fr">Alors que le temps cyclique était le temps de l'illusion
  immobile, vécu réellement, le temps spectaculaire est le temps de la réalité
  qui se transforme, vécu illusoirement.</q>, translated as "Whereas cyclical
  time was the time of unchanging illusion, actually lived; spectacular time is
  the time of changing reality, lived illusorily."
]{#fn155.1 .fn}
as changed by the influence of spectacular history, but this history is an
illusory experience, one merely witnessed through the [media]{.ix}.

### 156

The process of [commodity production]{.ix data-ix="production, of commodities"}
continually innovates new, cheaper, and more efficient methods to produce the
same products. As such, consumption is relegated to the mere repetition of the
same products with decreasing costs, and decreasing quality. Under the reign of
[spectacular time]{.ix data-ix="time, spectacular"}, dead labor dominates living
labor,[
  dead labor / living labor: Dead labor is without actual creation: a passive
  form of rent seeking, control of capital flows and the management of living
  labor; the labor of the ruling class. Living labor is the labor to reproduce
  the material basis of everyday life, labor of the working class, and creators;
  those actually producing services, products, and affects. For more on
  affective labor, see Hardt, M. & Negri, A., 2000.
]{#fn156.1 .fn .ix data-ix="labor, dead;labor, living"}
and the past accumulations of [capital]{.ix} continue to dominate the present
creation of time and history.[
  "the past accumulations of capital… dominate the present": Full
  quote is "In bourgeois society, the past dominates the present; in communist
  society, the present dominates the past." See Marx, K., Engels, F. & Jones,
  G., 2002 (Part 2).
]{#fn156.2 .fn}

### 157

[Historical time]{.ix data-ix="historical time"} lacks the histories of
individual human lives. The individual human life is still not historical since
its events are not recorded and simplified into a linear narrative. Furthermore,
the [pseudo-events]{.ix} popularized and dramatized by the spectacle are not
actually experienced by the individuals who watch them. In any case, these
pseudo-events are immediately made irrelevant by the novelty-generation
mechanism inherent to the spectacle. On the other hand, what life events have
actually been experienced have no relation to the
official [irreversible historical time]{.ix data-ix="irreversible time"} which
dominates society. The [actual lived
experiences]{.ix data-ix="directly lived experience"} of life remain outside the
allocation of [pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix} (the time legitimated by the time of
production.) So while work remains something
[perceived]{.ix data-ix="perception"} as 'apart from life', and '[free
time]{.ix data-ix="time, free"}' remains perceived as more authentically real
life, the real lived experience of commuting, doing chores, child care, cooking,
sleeping, etc, is therefore cut off, as separate from 'real life', remaining
undocumented and unaccounted from any personal or [historical time]{.ix}. This
deprives daily life of [language]{.ix} and as a formal concept, and it lacks any
analysis of what [events]{.ix} occurred within its own past, events which have
not been communicated. The real time of life is misunderstood, forgotten,
undertheorized, and smothered—to the benefit of the
[fake]{.ix data-ix="fakeness"} memories of the spectacle: a memory of the
unmemorable.

### 158

The [spectacle]{.ix} then, as the reigning system of social organization, is a
method for the paralysis of [history]{.ix} and [memory]{.ix}. The spectacular
society has abandoned a history based upon historical [events]{.ix}. This is a
society with a _[false consciousness]{.ix data-ix="consciousness, false"} of
time_.

### 159

A prerequisite for the conscription of the [working class]{.ix} as "free"
producers[
  "free producers": Free as in liberated to produce and consume as they see fit.
  Under Spectacular time, the worker is no longer free when they perceive time
  within the narrow understanding of time alternating between the time of
  production and consumable time. This is a false dichotomy of course. Their
  pseudo-free choice is in fact contingent on their time having been stolen in
  the first place.
]{#fn159.1 .fn}
and consumers of commodity time was the _[violent]{.ix data-ix="violence"}
expropriation of that time_. Spectacular time was only possible after this first
[dispossession]{.ix} of the producer.

### 160

The irreducibly biological element of [labor]{.ix} is its natural human cycles:
the workers dependence on [sleep]{.ix} and waking, health and injury—both attest
to the accumulation of [irreversible time]{.ix} as the inevitable truth of
aging. Contemporary production systems consider these natural and inevitable
factors as _secondary_ concerns. As such, aging and health are ignored by the
economy of capitalist production as externalities that have no bearing on the
production of consumable widgets, new inventions, and entertainment. The
individual [spectator]{.ix data-ix="spectators"} trapped at the center of
spectacular society can not experience a conscious sense of life as a journey
moving towards fulfillment, or the inevitable march to death. Instead, life
remains in stasis, on-hold for the next spectacular event. As such, we
who have given up the idea of living will surely never be able to embrace our
own [death]{.ix}. Life insurance [advertisements]{.ix data-ix="advertising"}
stake their business strategy on a [moral]{.ix data-ix="morality"} falsehood
that claims that it is reprehensible to die without first ensuring the
continuation of one's economic productivity. In _The American Way of Death_,[
  _The American Way of Death_ is an allusion to the book about the American
  funeral industry. See Mitford, J. 1978.
]{#fn160.1 .fn .ix data-ix="American Way of Death, The (Mitford)"}
death itself is advertised as an inversion, an event that attempts to maintain
the _[appearance]{.ix data-ix="appearances"}_ of life by means of excessive
sentimentality, ostentatious displays of [wealth]{.ix}, and an overly
commercialized industry to support it.
Alongside the continual bombardment of [advertising]{.ix}, it is forbidden to
get old, everyone's "[youth-capital]{.ix data-ix="capital, youth"}" must be
economized, while all models, [celebrities]{.ix data-ix="celebrity"} and actors
remain forever young. Thus, despite our collective efforts to economize youth,
it has none of the lasting and cumulative properties of financial capital. The
social absence of death is equal to the social absence of life.

### 161

As described by [Hegel]{.ix data-ix="Hegel, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich"}, time is
the _necessary_ [alienation]{.ix}, as we age we gradually lose our sense of self
and discover our true selves. Time is the environment in which we become the
other, the thing outside ourselves we didn't understand, and in becoming other,
we become a more fully understood self. The opposite is true of the
[alienation]{.ix} generated by the [spectacle]{.ix} of late capitalism—this is
an alienation felt as disenfranchisement from meaningfully
[participating]{.ix data-ix="participation"} in the historical events of ones
lifetime. We may [spectate]{.ix data-ix="spectators"} but we cannot participate,
absolute alienation in the _foreign present_. This is _[spatial
alienation]{.ix data-ix="alienation, spatial"}_, the society that separates the
[subject]{.ix data-ix="subjectivity"} from participating in the events of our
own time, foreclosing our individual ability to experience self-discovery
through aging. The [beauties and graces]{.ix data-ix="beauty;grace"} of
the naturally alienating process of time has instead been petrified, and the
risks of _lived_ self-creation and discovery have been eliminated.

### 162

In contrast to the _passing fashions_[
  "passing fashions": Those trivialities that get the most spectacular attention
  in the media, but are so often immediately irrelevant soon after.
  Examples include "issues"-oriented political debate, political scandals and
  palace intrigues, clothing, diet and food fads, internet memes, television &
  film, and video game entertainment.
]{#fn162.1 .fn} that preoccupy [pseudo-cyclical time]{.ix}, the _dominant
styles_ that actually influence the contemporary period are carefully
obfuscated and hidden—these can be recognized as the main concerns that will
cause revolution if they become apparent and revealed.

### 163

The motion of time exists despite human beings, it is only concretely
experienced as moments when society consciously segments and describes time for
_human use_. The [perception]{.ix} of time for any [society]{.ix} is determined
by its stage of [human labor]{.ix data-ix="labor, human"}: under [agrarian
labor]{.ix data-ix="labor, agrarian"} and [cyclical time]{.ix}, time is
humanized and therefore any individual is able to
[participate]{.ix data-ix="participation"} in the historical events of their
own time; under economic productive labor and [irreversible historical
time]{.ix data-ix="irreversible time"}, that time is dehumanized—the individual
cannot meaningfully participate in the lived historical events of their own
period. The revolutionary project of realizing a classless society goes along
with an inclusive historical life, one in which all people can participate in
the events of their own historical period. This project entails the withering
away of a singular measure of historical time in favor of a more humane,
individualized, and _federated multiplicity of independent times_,[
  "federated multiplicity of independent times": This project entails the
  withering away of a unified measure of time, an allusion to the anarchist
  concept of replacing the nation state with federations of independent
  communi­ties. This is also a postmodernist perspective of time, in that the
  abolition of a singular chronicle entails an abolition of grand-metanarratives
  as well as a unified perspective on "truth"—in favor of a multiplicity of
  timelines and perspectives which are all equally valid.
]{#fn163.1 .fn .ix data-ix="federation;multitude;metanarratives;Postmodernism"}
ones which are playful in nature, where every individual time can interplay and
[unify]{.ix data-ix="unity"} on an ad-hoc basis, where all timelines are
[autonomous]{.ix data-ix="autonomous, time"}, valid, and simultaneously present.
A successful realization of this revolutionary project is a generalized, fully
[conscious]{.ix data-ix="consciousness"} conception of time, determined by
personal life events which are recorded into a new historical record, a personal
[chronology]{.ix} that can be flexibly federated into other personal
[chronicles]{.ix} voluntarily and playfully—a sort of [communism]{.ix} that
suppresses all spectacular media-driven and universalized histories. This would
be a communism that suppresses and "abolishes everything that exists
independently of individuals",[
  "abolishes everything that exists independently of individuals": C.f. Marx, K.
  & Engels, F. 1998 (Part 1, Ch. 4, Section 6). In essence, the autonomous
  spectacle and all forms of autonomous history and power will gradually
  disappear.
]{#fn163.2 .fn}
in essence, a project to abolish the historical time of kings, the chronicle,
the government with their official time and finally to abolish [spectacular
time]{.ix data-ix="time, spectacular"}.

### 164

The world has already [dreamt]{.ix data-ix="dreams"} of such a time[
  "The world already dreams of such a time": See Marx, K., September 1843.
]{#fn164.1 .fn}—it has to just [wake]{.ix data-ix="sleep"} and remember to
really live it.
